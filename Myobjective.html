    <h1>My objectives: </h1>
    <h2>I. General Objective</h2>
    <p>I plan to acquire a robust foundation in computer science and software development, 
        enabling me to innovate and implement effective technological solutions for 
        Burundi's pressing issues, particularly in data management and internet infrastructure.</p>
    <h1>II. SMART Objectives: </h1>
<ol>
    <li> <h2>Short term objective</h2></li>
    <p>By December 2025, I look forward to complete five online courses or certifications focusing on data structures,
         algorithms, a modern programming language, database management (SQL), 
         and web development fundamentals. I will achieve this by dedicating 15 hours per week to coursework
          and practical exercises, evidenced by course completion certificates and the creation 
          of two small portfolio projects demonstrating learned concepts.</p>
    
    <li><h2>Long Term Objective</h2></li>
    <p> Within five years (by June 2030),I envision to design, develop, and deploy at least one impactful
         software solution or system that demonstrably improves data accessibility or internet
          efficiency for a specific community or sector in Burundi. This project will be measurable 
          by user adoption rates (e.g., 500+ users), improved service metrics,
           or positive feedback from stakeholders, contributing directly to 
           mitigating Burundi's technological challenges.</p>
